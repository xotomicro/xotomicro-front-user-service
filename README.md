# 0. register packages - yarn (ask owner for token)
export GITHUB_TOKEN=${ASKED_GITHUB_TOKEN} # first set accessibility rules for your team and add your github token like so 
npm set "//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}" # you will need to tell npm to authenticate yourself to install registries

# 1. clone, read and run required service from : https://github.com/xotomicro/xotomicro-front-shell-system/blob/development/README.md
git clone https://github.com/xotomicro/xotomicro-front-shell-system.git # clone then run the shell
